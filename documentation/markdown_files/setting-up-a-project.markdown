# Setting up a project

Hotdoc can accept options both from the command line and from a json
configuration file. The command line options will take precedence over
their json counterpart.

To see a list of all options available (including extension's options), run:

``` shell
hotdoc help
```

## Setting up a project from scratch.

You will first need to create the markdown files that will constitute the
"skeleton" of your documentation, see the
[page creation tutorial](the-markdown-pages.markdown#page-creation-tutorial)
for more information.

If you followed this tutorial up to its end you should now know how to
structure your markdown files together and how to define in which pages
individual source code symbols should be placed.

If you need more inspiration, check out the [examples section](examples.markdown)
