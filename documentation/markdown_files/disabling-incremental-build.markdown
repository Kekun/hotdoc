## Disabling incremental build

By default, rebuild is incremental, which vastly reduces the time needed to build
the documentation.

As this is still an experimental feature, if you wish to
rebuild everything at each run you can simply [clean](cleaning.markdown) hotdoc's output beforehand,
please file a bug if you have any reason to do that though.
