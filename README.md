This project needs a logo. In the meantime, eyes will get hurt by this

Hotdoc is a documentation micro-framework. It provides an interface for
extensions to plug upon, along with some base objects (formatters, ...)

Please check the packages listed at [https://github.com/hotdoc](https://github.com/hotdoc) to
pick the extensions you are interested in.

You can find the documentation for hotdoc, by hotdoc [here](https://people.collabora.com/~meh/hotdoc_hotdoc/html/index.html)
